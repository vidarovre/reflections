When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	If I want to work on my files from different computers or allowing others to work on
	my files or maybe just for backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	It could be difficult to have control over the changes. Especially if there are many
	people contributing to the project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks, clones, and branches are all ways to add new changes without
    affecting the existing version.  With branches the new changes are added in
    the same repository.  Forking and cloning both copy an entire repository to
    a new location.  The difference between forking and cloning is that forking
    is a special construct made by GitHub.  You can only fork a GitHub
    repository to another location on GitHub, while you can clone any Git
    repository to anywhere you have access to.

    I use branching for most cases where I want to add new changes to a
    repository while keeping an easy reference to a previous version, especially
    when collaborating with other people.  I clone a repository on GitHub when I
    want to work on that repository locally rather than using the GitHub
    website.  I fork a repository on GitHub when I want to make changes to that
	repository public, but I don't have permission to modify the original.
