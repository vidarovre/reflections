When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	If I want to work on my files from different computers or allowing others to work on
	my files or maybe just for backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	It could be difficult to have control over the changes. Especially if there are many
	people contributing to the project.
